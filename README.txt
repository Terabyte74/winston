winston is the newest version of WinstonAI, the helpful cmd created in 2019 by WINSONâ„¢ team.

as soon as you have winston installed on your system you have to install all the libraries
required through this command:

>>> cd "[path-to-new_wisnton-directory]"
>>> pip install -r requirements.txt

if you have problems installing the program or you're not used with python dynamics do not worry,
wizard for dummies is here for you: just look for the 'wizard_for_dummies' directory.

WARING: this is still the beta so you might find some bugs, in particular in the first phase:
>DO NOT< interrupt or close the program during the protocol of creation of your admin account
 if that happens you have to uninstall and reinstall the whole program.
