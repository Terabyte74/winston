wizard for dummies is the simplest protocol you could look for to have wisnton operating
on your system in the easiest and fastest way.
if your will is to modify winston or you justa have a virtual env of your own you don't
need this, otherwise, if you're a user who just wants to use the program this wizard is 
perfect for you. Just follow this simple steps:

1. make sure you have the latest version of python installed on your system
    (if not just open the cmd and write "python", then procede with the installation).

2. open the wizard.py file.
    this will:
     - install all the requirements needed on your main environment.
     - create a link to winston in his environment, which you will be
       able to use to pen winston with just one touch or rather.. two clicks. 

3. a new file has been created on your winston directory, you'll now be able to access
   the full-featured version winston just running that file.
   (the file can be moved wherever you want).
